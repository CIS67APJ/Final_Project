CIS67 Final Project
The idea behind this project is about linking various social media accounts.  Currently, the user can create an account,
on our site, which is stored on a database hosted by MongoLab.  Once the user logs into their created account, they are
directed to our accounts page where they can link their facebook and twitter accounts.  Currently, only the facebook
login is functioning.  Due to Facebook's restrictions on API calls, the only information currently returned to the user are
names and emails.  Once Facebook grants permission to the app, the user's timeline will be displayed on the feeds page.
Any names that appear on the feeds page is data pulled from the Facebook JSON response.  When the user is done, they can
click the logout link, which will terminate their session and return them to the homepage. Project is ready for demonstration
only, and not complete use.
